# Constructor-Sity_Virtual_Reality
I am very grateful to Sensorama Academy for giving me the opportunity to study at their institution and work on developing VR applications.
In this project we have succeeded in realizing the idea that every person wearing a virtual reality helmet will be able to realize the dream 
of his childhood and build a world in which buildings of different types, forms, parks, cars, people, objects with which you can have the opportunity to interact.
It is interesting that in our VR application you will be able to enjoy the interesting landscape of the skyscraper built by you using the principle of teleporting
from place to place, climb buildings on ladders, lifts, navigate between houses on a cable car, and also try your hand at a sport like rock climbing.
