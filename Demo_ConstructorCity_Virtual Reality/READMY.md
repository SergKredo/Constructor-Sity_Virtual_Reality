# ConstructorCity_Virtual-Reality
My student course project with guys about Constructor buildings and city in VR and AR.
If you want to play the demo version of the ConstructorCity application in Virtual Reality. You need to download all the zip files from the github to a separate folder on your computer and then unzip file "Constructor-Sity_Virtual_Reality-master.zip", further open to the zip archive "Demo_ConstructorCity_Virtual Reality.zip" and play the "VRCONSTRUCTOR(Final).exe" file.
